I started my studies in Amsterdam, at the UvA, in 1989. After my first year I switched to study experimental Psychology in Groningen t the RuG. I received my masters in 1995.

I received my PhD in Experimental Psychology at the University of Amsterdam in 2002 on a thesis titled: [*Age related changes in executive control: models, methods and developmental trends.*](/assets/Thesis.pdf)

I am currently working at the University of Groningen as a Scientific Advisor at Research Support of BSS and as a teacher at Experimental Psychology.
