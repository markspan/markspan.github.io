I received my PhD in Experimental Psychology at the University of Amsterdam in 2001 on a thesis titles: Age related changes in executive control: models, methods and developmental trends.

I am currently working at the University of Groningen as a Scientific Advisor at Research Support of BSS and as a teacher at Experimental Psychology.
