I received my PhD in Experimental Psychology at the University of Amsterdam in 2002 on a thesis titled: [*Age related changes in executive control: models, methods and developmental trends.*](/assets/Thesis.pdf)

I am currently working at the University of Groningen as a Scientific Advisor at Research Support of BSS and as a teacher at Experimental Psychology.
