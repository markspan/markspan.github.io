## Description:

JATOS is a server environment to host OSWEB (OpenSesame) tasks for online deployment.

---
## Usage:
Apply for an account on the JATOS server of BSS (link above).

Create your task in such a way it will pass the OSWEB test (Menu of OpenSesame: Tools - OSWEB). Export the task as JATOS study.

This will create a zipfile (e.g., Task.zip). Login to your JATOS account. 

Select "Import Study" and select the created zipfile (e.g., Task.zip).

The study will now be available in your "List of studies" at the left side of your screen. When selected, you can now create
batches and workers as described in the [JATOS manuals](https://www.jatos.org/)

This is also the place you can export the data on "workers" that have finished the task.
