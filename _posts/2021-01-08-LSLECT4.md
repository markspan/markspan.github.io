Program to retrieve live recordings of the signals (detected R-tops) from an ECT4 device creating an [labstreaminglayer](https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer) Marker stream to create timestamps for each retrieved datapoint.

As the screenshot shows: no real configuration needed. The attached ECT-4 will stream its data trough an LSL stream named "ECT4".
