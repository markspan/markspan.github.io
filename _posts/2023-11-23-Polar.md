# [PolarBand2lsl](https://github.com/markspan/PolarBand2lsl)

## PolarBand2lsl
Send PolarBand H10 Data to an [LSL](https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer) stream.

## Manual:
1. **Install [Python](https://www.anaconda.com/):**
   - If not installed, download and install Python.

2. **Open an Anaconda Prompt:**
   - Open an Anaconda prompt and execute the following commands:
     ```bash
     pip install pylsl --user
     pip install bleak --user
     ```
     *This installs [pylsl](https://pypi.org/project/pylsl/) for LSL support and [bleak](https://bleak.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for Bluetooth Low Energy communication.*

3. **Platform Compatibility:**
   - This solution is expected to work on PC, MAC, and Linux since **bleak** is used for Bluetooth LE communication.

4. **Configure the Code:**
   - Change to the directory with this code. Update the MAC address in the code to match the MAC address of your band.

5. **Run the Stream:**
   - Execute the following command:
     ```bash
     python Polar2LSL
     ```
     *This starts the LSL stream.*

6. **Recording:**
   - Record the stream with [Labrecorder](https://github.com/labstreaminglayer/App-LabRecorder/releases).

7. **Sample Script for Peak Detection:**
   - A sample script for peak detection is provided, based on [Matlab Documentation](https://nl.mathworks.com/help/wavelet/ug/r-wave-detection-in-the-ecg.html).
     - This script uses the xdf import module of LabStreamingLayer (https://github.com/xdf-modules/xdf-Matlab) and the 'findpeaks' function from the MATLAB Signal Processing Toolbox.

8. **GUI Version:**
   - Additionally, I've developed a GUI version that wraps around the code using Kivy. This GUI offers several advantages, such as the ability to discover nearby POLAR bands. You can find the [release](https://github.com/markspan/PolarBand2lsl/releases/tag/v1.0.0) for windows only.
