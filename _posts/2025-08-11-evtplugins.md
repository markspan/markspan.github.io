# pyevt - A python binder for the Event-Exchanger EVT-2 USB hardware

## 1. About
This repository contains the code to communicate with *EVT-2* USB-devices, developed by the Research Support group of the faculty of Behavioral and Social Science from the University of Groningen. This code was originally written by Eise Hoekstra and Mark M. Span and is now maintained by Martin Stokroos

The *EVT-2* is an event marking and triggering device intended for physiological experiments.
*pyevt* is a Python module to communicate with *EVT-2* hardware (+derivatives).

## 2. Install
Install pyevt with:

`pip install pyevt` or
`pip install --user pyevt` on managed computers.

## 3. Dependencies
The *pyevt*-library uses the *HIDAPI* python module to communicate over USB according the HID class.
![https://pypi.org/project/hidapi/](https://pypi.org/project/hidapi/)

## 4. Device Permission for Linux
In Linux (Ubuntu), permission for using EVT (HID) devices should be given by adding the next lines to a file, for example named: `99-evt-devices.rules` in `/etc/udev/rules.d`:

```
# /etc/udev/rules.d/99-evt-devices.rules

# All EVT devices
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="0004", MODE="0660", GROUP="plugdev"
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="0008", MODE="0660", GROUP="plugdev"
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="0009", MODE="0660", GROUP="plugdev"
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="0114", MODE="0660", GROUP="plugdev"
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="0208", MODE="0660", GROUP="plugdev"
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="0308", MODE="0660", GROUP="plugdev"
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="0408", MODE="0660", GROUP="plugdev"
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="0508", MODE="0660", GROUP="plugdev"
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="0604", MODE="0660", GROUP="plugdev"
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="0808", MODE="0660", GROUP="plugdev"
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="0909", MODE="0660", GROUP="plugdev"
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="1803", MODE="0660", GROUP="plugdev"
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="1807", MODE="0660", GROUP="plugdev"
```

The user should be a member of the `plugdev` -group.

Check with:

`$ groups username`

If this is not the case, add the user to the plugdev group by typing:

`$ sudo usermod -a -G plugdev username`

## 5. Python coding examples

```
from pyevt import EventExchanger

myevt = EventExchanger()
# Get list of devices containing the partial string 'partial_device_name'
myevt.scan('partial_device_name') # The default is 'EventExchanger'.

# Create a device handle:
myevt.attach_name('partial_device_name') # Example: 'EVT02', 'SHOCKER' or 'RSP-12', etc. The default is 'EventExchanger'.

myevt.write_lines(0) # clear outputs
myevt.pulse_lines(170, 1000) # value=170, duration=1000ms

# remove device handle
myevt.close()

# connect RSP-12
myevt.attach_name('RSP-12')
myevt.wait_for_event(3, None) # wait for button 1 OR 2, timeout is infinite.
myevt.close() # remove device handle

```

The BSS Research Support OpenSesame Plugin Collection
=====================================================

*An OpenSesame plugin collection for sending stimulus synchronization triggers and response collection through Event Exchanger (EVT-2) USB-devices.*  

Copyright 2010-2024 Mark Span (<m.m.span@rug.nl>), M. Stokroos (<m.stokroos@rug.nl>)

Contributions: This code is based on the work of Eise Hoekstra and Mark M. Span. The code is debugged and rewritten for OpenSesame 4 by Martin Stokroos.

## 1. About
The BSS Research Support OpenSesame Plugin Collection for use with Event Exchanger (EVT-2) USB-devices.

EVT-devices and the associated plugins are developed by the [Research Support](https://myuniversity.rug.nl/infonet/medewerkers/profiles/departments/11422) department from the faculty of Behavioural and Social Sciences from the University of Groningen.

The currently supported OpenSesame version is: 4.

The following plugins are available:

icon | plugin | Description | OpenSesame back-end | operating system | Status
---- | ------- | ----------- | ------------------- | ---------------- | ------
![](opensesame_plugins/evt_plugins/evt_trigger/evt_trigger_large.png) | *evt_trigger* | plugin for event exchanger EVT-2,3 and 4 variants for generating triggers | PyGame, PsychoPy | Windows | ok
![](opensesame_plugins/evt_plugins/response_box/response_box_large.png) | *response_box* | plugin for all of the RSP12x button response box variants with 1-8 buttons | PyGame, PsychoPy | Windows | ok

### Package dependencies
The plugins are dependent on the Python module pyevt and the underlying hidapi package.

[https://pypi.org/project/hidapi/](https://pypi.org/project/hidapi/)

*pyevt* and *hidapi* are installed from the Python Console in OpenSesame with the single command:

`!pip install --user pyevt`

NOTE: Currently, the plugin package is released as pip package in a test environment. Clone this repository and copy the plugins manually into your OpenSesame python package folder or temporary install from the command line in OpenSesame 4 with:

```
!pip install --user hidapi
!pip install --user --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ pyevt
!pip install --user --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ evt-plugins
```

### Environmental settings
By default, the OpenSesame 4.0 plugins are installed as python site-package and automatically loaded at the startup.
When the plugins are located somewhere else, add your path to the python-path of OpenSesame in the `environment.yaml` file in the OpenSesame program directory (The OPENSESAME_plugin_PATH is old style). See for the instructions here: [https://rapunzel.cogsci.nl/manual/environment/](https://rapunzel.cogsci.nl/manual/environment/) 

## 2. Plugin Descriptions

*evt_trigger*

Existing modes:

- Clear output lines
- Write output line
- Invert output lines
- Pulse output lines

*response_box*

Collects responses from a 1 to 8 button RSP-12x response box.

After the prepare phase of the plugin, a workspace variable `connected_device_plugin_instance_name` is created to check if the actual tactile-stimulator device is really detected and connected to the plugin.

*rsp_pygame*

This response-box plugin works for EVT devices as well for joystick devices. It makes use of the pygame joystick API and is platform independent. 

*tactile_stimulator*

The tactile_stimulator plugin operates in two modes. Usually two instances of this plugin are used in the OpenSesame experiment. Mode-I, the `Calibration`-mode should always precede the `Stimulate`-mode. In `Calibration`-mode the upper limit of stimulus-current threshold is set between 0 and 5mA rms. In the `Stimulate`-mode, a percentage of the stimulus-current upper limit is set to be applied to the subject. The `Calibration`-mode can be used standalone for instance to precondition the subject. The pulse duration can be extended up to 2000ms.

After the prepare phase of the plugin, a workspace variable `connected_device_plugin_instance_name` is created to check if the actual tactile-stimulator device is really detected and connected to the plugin.

Here below follows a list of variables that appear in the OpenSesame variable inspector when using the tactile_stimulator plugin:

variable name | description
------------- | -----------
`tactstim_calibration_perc` | The percentage of the slider setting for the stimulus current of up to 5mA rms max.
`tactstim_calibration_milliamp` | The calibration value of the stimulus current in mA's. This is the max. current applied to the subject.
`tactstim_calibration_value`| The byte value representation of the calibrated current.
`tactstim_pulse_milliamp` | The actual current in mA's, applied to the subject when pulsing.
`tactstim_pulse_value` | The actual byte value representation that is sent to the tactile stimulator.
`tactstim_pulse_duration_ms` | The pulse duration time in ms.
`tactstim_time_last_pulse` | Unique time stamp in seconds from the moment of the shock.

*vas_evt*

A Visual Analog Slider plugin controlled by an EVT rotary or linear encoder.
The *vas_evt* plugin does not work standalone, but requires a linkage to a custom designed sketchpad screen.

*vas_gui*

A Visual Analog Slider plugin. The *vas_gui* plugin does not work standalone, but requires a linkage to a custom designed sketchpad screen with an analog slider design!

Here below is the list of the variables that will appear in the OpenSesame variable inspector when using the vas_gui plugin:

variable name | description
------------- | -----------
`vas_response` | This value is the reading from the VAS object, ranging from 0 to 100.
`vas_response_time` | this is the repsonse time in ms. The value -1 means that the timeout period was reached.

*rgb_led_control*

This plugin works for the RSP-LT device, a response-box with RGB-controlled LED buttons.
