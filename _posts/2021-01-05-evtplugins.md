## Usage:

Start Opensesame *as Administrator*.
Open the debug window of OpenSesame

```
 pip install evtplugins
```
and then, if this results in succes, close opensesame, and open it again, but now no need for administrators rights anymore.

If all went well, the plugins are now availeable in your toolbox.
